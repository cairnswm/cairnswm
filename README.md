# Hi 
I'm CairnsWM (William Cairns), I live in South Africa. I live in Randburg, Johannesburg, (South Africa) but enjoy travelling and like visiting places for a short-medium term, especiially if I can work and play somewhere interesting. I have both American and South African citizenship.

I am currently working as a Frontend Engineer at Equal Experts.

## I am
- A Passionate Software Developer ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-Javascript-informational?style=flat&logo=code&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-Typescript-informational?style=flat&logo=code&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)
- A Long Distance Cyclist
- A Fantasy fan - D&D and Fantasy Fiction

## I consider my key skills to be
- Javascript/React
- Well architected AI Coding
- Software Engineering
- Technical Team Leadership
- Team Mentorship
- Modern Software Development processes
- Application Architecture Best Practises

## I am Certified as
- Microsoft Certified Developer (C#, Javascript, Azure) (expired)
- AWS Cloud Practitioner (Expired)
- AWS Certified Developer Associate (Expired)

## I have studied
- B.Comm Information Systems (Pretoria)
- MSc Computer Science with Software Engineering (Glyndwr) (https://online.glyndwr.ac.uk/msc-computer-science-with-software-engineering/)

## I currently use
- Javascript
- React
- PHP
- mySQL

_People often ask why PHP and MySQL - well they can be hosted anywhere really cheaply. I enjoy front end development a lot more so useing PHP to very quickly generate APIs makes front end more fun. Oh, Generative AI knows PHP really well, so I seldom have to do any PHP work myself._

## I used to use
- .Net, C#
- SQL Server
- Delphi
- Oracle
- C++
- AWS
- and lots more

_Learning a language/technology usually takes me a few weeks to be productive, and about 6 months before I start wanting to build my own libraries etc._

_Some AI tools make a lot of commits while developing. So the number of commits looks inflated :)_
